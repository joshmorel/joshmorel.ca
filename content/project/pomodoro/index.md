My own take on a web app to practice the <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pomodoro technique</a> for focused productivty.

Leverages: 

* Canvas API to visualize remaining time in current interval
* `localStorage` to save settings
* Favicon replacement indication of remaining time from browser tab 
* jQuery for timed updates
